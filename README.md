# GRACEbeamline
Simulation of the antiprotons paths trough the GRACE apparatus. 
This program was developed as a part of my PhD thesis that I will provide a linkt to here as soon as I have defended it. 
The relevant documentation and manual for running an example of this program is found in [here](GRACEbeamlineDocumentation.pdf)
